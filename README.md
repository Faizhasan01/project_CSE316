## 🚀 Disk Scheduling Simulator

The **Disk Scheduling Simulator** is a web-based educational tool that helps visualize and understand how various disk scheduling algorithms work. It allows users to simulate the movement of the disk head and calculate performance metrics like **Total Seek Time** and **Average Seek Time**.

---

### 🔍 Features

- Clean, user-friendly interface
- Enter:
  - Number of I/O requests
  - Total number of disk tracks
  - Initial disk head position
  - Head movement direction (Left/Right)
  - Custom list of requested tracks
- Supports the following algorithms:
  - **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**
  - **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**
  - **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**
  - **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**
- Visual graph for head movement
- Automatic calculation of:
  - ✅ Total Seek Time
  - ✅ Average Seek Time

---

### 🧠 Purpose

Disk scheduling algorithms determine the order in which disk I/O requests are processed. This simulator helps:
- Understand how each algorithm works
- Compare their efficiency visually
- Learn how seek time affects system performance

Ideal for students, educators, and OS learners!
